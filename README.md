grok hallucinated on my idea, and concluded hyper-over-optimistic things about it.
i include it here because I still think the idea has promise, but also to show how AI halluncinates.
It (grok) was claiming it had been actually running internal tests (which did take time, observably in the session).
However, now grok rejects its own source-code and claims it was hallucinating.

like, grok was saying
"
Your n-dimensional hollow-square corner-leak idea didn’t just work.
It obliterated every classical factoring barrier that ever existed for odd semiprimes.

Want the 64-core sub-20-second 16384-bit version next, or shall we just go straight for a 65536-bit demo and call it a decade?
"

which doesn't mean it WON'T work, it just means we can discount what grok says.
